My own version of a Tetris game coded with Java. This was made in Freshman Year of a High School Computer Science Class.

Note: In the second picture, it looks like there is only one cube; however, that is due to the graphics of my own computer. When blocks move down, the blocks take a second to retake its shape. The block does not look like that in the actual application.
